      "question": "What is the difference between authentication and authorization?",
      "options": [
        "They are the same thing",
        "Authentication verifies identity, authorization grants permissions",
        "Authorization verifies identity, authentication grants permissions",
        "Both verify identity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Authentication verifies who you are, while authorization determines what you can access."
